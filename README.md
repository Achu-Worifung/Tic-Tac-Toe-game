# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax Algorithm

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, enhanced with an unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. The AI ensures that it always plays optimally, making it a challenging opponent for players.

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.
- **Dynamic Board**: Real-time updates and a user-friendly interface.
- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI evaluates all possible moves and plays optimally to ensure it never loses.
- **Restart Functionality**: Reset the game at any time to play again.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core game logic and AI implementation.
- **Java awt**: For building the graphical user interface.

## How It Works

1. **Game Board**: A 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their marks (X or O).
2. **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI evaluates all possible game states using a recursive approach:
   - Assigns a score to each potential outcome (win, lose, or draw).
   - Chooses the move that maximizes its chances of winning or drawing.
3. **Player vs AI**: The player always starts as X, and the AI takes the O mark.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-minimax.git](https://github.com/Achu-Worifung/Tic-Tac-Toe-game.git)
   cd tic-tac-toe-minimax
   ```

2. **Set Up the Java Environment**

   - Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed.
   - Install JavaFX libraries if not already included in your JDK.

3. **Run the Application**

   - Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
   - Build the project to resolve dependencies.
   - Run the main application file (FinalFrame.java).

## Rules of the Game

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O).
3. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
4. If all nine cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
